This link is to a WebGL globe population tracker from 1990 to 2000. The more the population grows 
through the years the lines will show by extending and change to a more intense color. I really
liked the design and how the idea could be repeated with different data. i.e. volcanos on earth, most
popular universities, sports stadiums, etc.
